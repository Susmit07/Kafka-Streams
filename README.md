# Kafka-Streams

Kafka Streams real time project
---------------------------------------------
There are 3 different projects, out of which the banking transaction is the real time aggreagation project and other 2 are starter Kafka streams project. I have included test cases as well, and the Kafka commands to create streams topics, same will be present under resources directory within a file name kafka_config.properties
